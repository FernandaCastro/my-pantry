# My Pantry

version: 0.1.0

- Internationalization (EN-PT)
- CRUD for Supermarkets and its particular order of categories
- New Permissions: list_supermarket, create_supermarket, edit_supermarket and delete_supermarket

### Description:

My Pantry manages pantries and automatically creates shopping lists as products are consumed from the
inventory. <br/> <br/>
You can also share your Pantries, Shopping Lists and Products with other users, by adding users to your Account Group.

The Authentication is possible by either Google Sign-in (Google IDToken - having localhost as callback) or by the
traditional user/password.

The frontend is developed in Reactjs and Javascript, while backend is written in Java 17, Spring Boot and Spring
Security.
