# My Pantry

<b>version: 0.9.2</b>

- pantry-web: v.0.8.7
- account-service: v0.4.6
- pantry-service: v0.6.6
- purchase-service: v0.4.5

### In this version:

- <b>account-service:</b>  Use Redis to cache RBAC requests (permissions and access control)

Plans for next versions:

- Delete provisioned products from the shopping list (on Shopping List page)

- Manually increasing or decreasing a quantity of a Pantry Item (on Pantry page), should analyse the provisioning for
  that item (creating, deleting, increasing or decreasing any provisioning for that item).

- CRUD for Role and Permissions

### Description:

My Pantry manages your pantries and creates shopping lists for you. Its core logic mechanism is the product
consumption. <br/>

##### Simply tell My Pantry that you opened a new package of pasta. The app will analyse the ideal and current quantities in your pantry, and in case the current quantity is below 50%, it will add Pasta to the Shopping List. <br/>

<b>RBAC</b> is implemented by the account-service and uses <b>Redis</b> as a cache support.You can also share your
Pantries, Shopping Lists and Products with other users, by adding them to your Account Group.

The Authentication is possible by either <b>Google Sign-in</b> (Google IDToken - configure it as localhost callback) or
by the
traditional user/password. A <b>JWT</b> is generated and stored as a http-only cookie.

The frontend is developed in Reactjs and Javascript.

Backend is written in Java 17, Spring Boot and Spring
Security, accessing Postgres as database, Redis as cache and Kafka as prov/sub for asynch communication between
pantry-service and purchase-service.

### How to run it locally:

#### Pre-steps:

1. Install **Docker** and **Maven**
2. Generate **SECURITY_SECRET** by running command: ```openssl rand -hex 64```
3. If you want to use **Google Sign-in**, then get a new Google Credentials for your MyPantry app:
    1. Log in at https://console.developers.google.com/apis
    2. Create a new project (MyPantry)
    3. Follow the instructions to configure
       it: https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid

#### Steps:

1. Download the source code
2. Configure the environment variables in the docker-compose.yml:
    - SECURITY_SECRET= **<SECURITY_SECRET>**
    - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID= **<CLIENT_ID generated by Google>**
    - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET= **<CLIENT_SECRET generated by Google>**
   - ALLOWED_ORIGINS= **<SAMPLE: http://loocalhost:3000, http://localhost:8080, http://localhost:8081>**
3. Navigate to my-pantry folder
4. Run: ```mvn clean install```
5. Run: ```docker-compose up -d```
