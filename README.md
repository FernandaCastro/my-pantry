# My Pantry

version: 0.0.4 <br />

- Access Control is now centralized in account_service, as part of the authorization.
  - Why? So far, Pantry and Product are the only relevant entities when it comes to access control. So instead of making
    purchase-service request access-control data to pantry-service, I decided to centralize it together with
    authorization logic in account-service.
- New Permission: PURCHASE_PANTRY Permissions refactored: CONSUME_PANTRY, ANALYSE_PANTRY
- Control the access to Purchases
- Purchase by selecting specific pantries or all

Plans for next versions:

- CRUD for Role and Permissions
- Wizards that create basic products and pantry with basic items
- CRUD for Supermarkets and its particular order of categories

### Description:

My Pantry manages pantries and automatically creates shopping lists as products are consumed from the
inventory. <br/> <br/>
You can also share your Pantries, Shopping Lists and Products with other users, by adding users to your Account Group.

The Authentication is possible by either Google Sign-in (Google IDToken - having localhost as callback) or by the
traditional user/password.

The frontend is developed in Reactjs and Javascript, while backend is written in Java 17, Spring Boot and Spring
Security.

### How to run it locally:

#### Pre-steps:

1. Install **Docker** and **Maven**
2. Generate **SECURITY_SECRET** by running command: ```openssl rand -hex 64```
3. If you want to use **Google Sign-in**, then get new Google Credentials for MyPantry app:
    1. Log in at https://console.developers.google.com/apis
    2. Create a new project (MyPantry)
    3. Follow the instructions to configure
       it: https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid

#### Steps:

1. Download the source code
2. Configure the environment variables in the docker-compose.yml:
    - SECURITY_SECRET= **<SECURITY_SECRET>**
    - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID= **<CLIENT_ID generated by Google>**
    - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET= **<CLIENT_SECRET generated by Google>**
3. Navigate to my-pantry folder
